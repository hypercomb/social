# 💛 Code of Conduct

hypercomb is built on **presence, consent, and recognition**. we keep it human, small, and live.

this code of conduct sets the **minimum expectations** for behavior in repos, issues, pull requests, discussions, and live demo spaces linked from this project.

> tl;dr — be kind, ask consent, move with care, leave gracefully.

---

## 🌱 principles

- **presence = permission** — no one is entitled to your time or attention.
- **consent to link** — ask before joining, following, or tagging people into threads.
- **recognition over accounts** — treat people as people; reputation is social, not gamified.
- **no extraction** — don’t scrape, log, or publish people’s paths without consent.
- **repair over blame** — if something goes wrong, help fix it and keep moving.

## ✅ expected behavior

- be respectful and constructive; assume good intent.
- use clear, specific feedback; suggest the smallest viable change.
- honor **no**, **not now**, and **unlink** (end a thread politely).
- keep demos and examples free of personal data.
- follow repo conventions (lowercase docs, readable link names, no telemetry).

---

## ❌ unacceptable behavior

- harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.
- doxxing or publishing private information.
- non-consensual recording, scraping, or replaying of live sessions.
- spam, automated astroturfing, or bot floods.
- bypassing consent (e.g., persistent requests after a refusal).

---

## 📍 scope

this applies to:
- all project spaces: repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, wikis.
- live demo sessions hosted or linked from this project.
- community chat spaces managed by the maintainers.

---

## 📨 reporting

if you experience or witness a violation:

1) keep yourself safe (unlink / mute / ignore as needed).  
2) save only what’s necessary to describe the event (no broad logging).  
3) contact the maintainers:

- email: **<add-contact-email@yourdomain>**  
- or open a private discussion with the title prefix: **“conduct:”**

> note: this project does not collect persistent logs. include minimal context in your report (links, screenshots) if you choose.

---

## 🔎 resolution

maintainers may, at their discretion:

- clarify expectations
- request a change in behavior
- limit or remove access to project spaces
- in severe cases, ban accounts from the org

we aim for **proportionate, fast, and minimal** actions that keep the space healthy.

---

## 🔒 privacy

- reports are kept confidential among maintainers unless disclosure is required for immediate safety.
- we avoid permanent dossiers; retain only what’s needed to address the incident.

---

## 🛠 updates

this document will evolve with community feedback. propose changes via a pull request titled **“docs(conduct): …”**.

## 💬 final note

hypercomb grows when we protect presence, honor consent, and move together with care. thank you for helping keep it human.
