# 🌿 Hypercomb Stewardship Pledge

we (the maintainers) commit that:

1) **never for sale**  
   we will not sell, transfer, or otherwise convey ownership of the hypercomb codebase, brand, or namespace to any private party.

2) **open source, always**  
   the code will remain open source under an osi-approved license. changes will not reduce freedoms already granted.

3) **service transparency**  
   any public instance we operate links to the exact source version (agpl “corresponding source”).

4) **community benefit**  
   roadmaps prioritize public benefit and contributor input. no exclusive access deals to core features.

5) **succession**  
   if maintainership must change, it will transfer to a neutral steward (nonprofit or public-benefit trust) with the same commitments.

> this pledge is governance, not a software license.
